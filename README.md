# challenge Application

The weather report application consumes a public Weather API which broadcasts the weather in two biggest cities BeiJing and Shanghai.
For this project, we will use 'npm install view-design --save', 'npm install vue-router' and 'npm install --save axios vue-axios'.
To have a persistent storage, users can download the current weather report as a local .txt file for future review.
